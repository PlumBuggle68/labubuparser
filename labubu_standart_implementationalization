## 1. Introduction

The **Labubu Standard** defines a decentralized, minimalist protocol for managing pixel art characters called "Labubus" on the Bitcoin network. This specification outlines the minting, identification, ownership, and validation rules for Labubu assets, relying on off-chain art and on-chain ownership indicators. The Labubu is not just a collectible but a digital token of identity, verified by the most minimal and robust infrastructure Bitcoin has to offer: a single satoshi.

This document serves as the definitive reference for developers, collectors, and explorers who wish to implement, interact with, or understand the Labubu Standard.

## 2. Philosophy of the Labubu

The Labubu Standard was created to champion:

* **Simplicity**: The protocol is minimal by design. It avoids complex scripting and metadata embedding in favor of deterministic rules.
* **Off-Chain Creativity**: Pixel art is generated off-chain but referenced and indexed by Bitcoin transaction data.
* **Ownership Authenticity**: A Labubu’s true owner is the holder of a specific satoshi, never a copy.
* **Fragile Scarcity**: Like a tamagotchi, a Labubu’s existence can be invalidated by careless handling—splitting its UTXO is akin to breaking a seal.

This fragility is intentional. It reflects both the impermanence and individuality of digital creatures.

---

## 3. System Architecture

The Labubu Standard consists of the following core components:

* **Labubu Control Block**: A specific format embedded in Bitcoin transactions.
* **Labubu Art Generator**: An off-chain deterministic pixel art generator driven by the transaction ID.
* **Labubu Assets Website**: A frontend that indexes, displays, and validates Labubus.
* **Ownership Verifier**: A utility to check the current holder of the Labubu based on the UTXO structure.

All interactions between these components center around Bitcoin transactions. No centralized registry, smart contracts, or metadata files are needed.

## 4. The Labubu Minting Process

### 4.1 Eligibility

A Labubu is minted when a transaction:

* Includes a **Labubu Control Block** in its witness or scriptSig.
* Has an **output of at least 1 satoshi**.

### 4.2 The Control Block

The control block is a chunk of data included in a transaction script that identifies it as a valid Labubu mint. It must contain:

```
OP_FALSE
OP_IF
  "labubu"
  "v1"
  "image/labubu-default"
  0x00
OP_ENDIF
```

This format, based on the ordinal theory inscription method, acts as the fingerprint of a Labubu mint.

### 4.3 TXID as the Seed

Once the transaction is confirmed, the **TXID** of the minting transaction becomes the unique seed used to generate the Labubu's appearance. The art is derived solely from this 64-character hexadecimal string.

## 5. Art Generation and Viewing

### 5.1 Deterministic Pixel Art

The Labubu image is generated via a deterministic off-chain pixel art generator. Input: TXID. Output: A small, black-and-white Labubu creature.

### 5.2 Viewing Labubus

Users can visit the [Labubu Assets Website](https://labubu.io) and enter a TXID or use an explorer index to view existing Labubus.

The site will:

* Validate the transaction includes a correct control block.
* Confirm that the output UTXO exists and is unspent.
* Generate and render the image using the TXID.

This makes Labubu art permanently viewable, yet unforgeable.

## 6. Ownership Tracking and Satoshi Identity

The true owner of a Labubu is the holder of the **first satoshi** in the **first output** of the minting transaction.

This satoshi is:

* **Non-fungible**: Only this satoshi can be used to prove ownership.
* **Indivisible**: Splitting the UTXO that contains it destroys the Labubu.

To verify ownership:

1. Find the UTXO created by the minting transaction.
2. Check that it is unspent.
3. Trace its history to confirm it is still intact (i.e., not split).

This mechanism treats the satoshi as a **pink slip**, akin to the title document of a car.

---

## 7. Validity and Integrity

A Labubu is considered valid if:

* The minting transaction includes the proper control block.
* The UTXO that contains the first satoshi is unspent.
* The UTXO has not been split or merged.

If the UTXO is:

* **Spent and not reassembled** → Labubu is void.
* **Part of a split output** → Labubu is permanently invalid.

There is **no recovery mechanism**. This strictness ensures integrity and enforces careful custody.

## 8. Technical Specification

### 8.1 Minting

* Must include control block as defined.
* Minimum output: 1 satoshi.

### 8.2 Script Format

Labubu control block in witness (if SegWit) or scriptSig:

```asm
OP_FALSE
OP_IF
  "labubu"
  "v1"
  "image/labubu-default"
  0x00
OP_ENDIF
```

### 8.3 Art Generation Logic

* Input: TXID (64-hex)
* Use SHA256 or custom PRNG for pixel layout
* Fixed size (e.g., 32x32 monochrome grid)

### 8.4 Validity Check

1. Check for Control Block.
2. Verify UTXO exists and is unspent.
3. UTXO must not have changed structure.

## 9. Use Cases and Future Directions

### 9.1 Collectibles

Labubus can be collected, traded (carefully), or displayed in wallets and galleries.

### 9.2 Games and Identity

They may serve as characters in games, digital pets, or wallet mascots.

### 9.3 Extensions

Future versions could include:

* Colored pixel art (with entropy from TXID)
* Evolving Labubus (based on sat age or movement)
* Cross-chain mirrors

### 9.4 Tooling

* Labubu Explorer
* Satoshi Ownership Verifier
* Wallet integration

## 10. Conclusion

The Labubu Standard offers a novel way to bind identity, art, and ownership to the smallest unit of Bitcoin. With no external dependencies, and complete reliance on Bitcoin-native mechanics, it embodies the ideals of digital permanence and self-custody.

Every Labubu is unique. Every Labubu can die. But every Labubu lives as long as its satoshi is held whole.

*Mint wisely. Guard closely.*
